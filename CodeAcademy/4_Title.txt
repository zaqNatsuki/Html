Page Titles
What kind of metadata about the web page can the <head> element contain?

If you navigate to the Codecademy catalog and look at the top of your browser, you¡¦ll notice the words Catalog | Codecademy, which is the title of the web page.

A browser¡¦s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>
If we were to open a file containing the HTML code in the example above, the browser would display the words My Coding Journal in the title bar (or in the tab¡¦s title).

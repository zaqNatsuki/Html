Divs
One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. <div> is short for ¡§division¡¨ or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
    <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
  </div>
</body>
<div>s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of <div>s for better readability.

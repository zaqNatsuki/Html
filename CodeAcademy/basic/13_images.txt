Images
All of the elements you¡¦ve learned about so far (headings, paragraphs, lists, and spans) share one thing in common: they¡¦re composed entirely of text! What if you want to add content to your web page that isn¡¦t composed of text, like images?

The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the <img> tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash ¡X both will render properly.

<img src="image-location.jpg" />
The <img> tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set to the image¡¦s source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored.

Line Breaks
The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn¡¦t affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML¡¦s line break element: <br>.

The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.

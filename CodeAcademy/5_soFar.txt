Where Does the Title Appear?
Good work! Unfortunately, the browser panel used by the Codecademy environment does not have a title bar, so the ¡§Brown Bear¡¨ title you wrote in the previous exercise will not be displayed.

So far, we have learned about:

1.<!DOCTYPE html>, the declaration specifying the version of HTML for the browser

2.The <html> tags that enclose all of your HTML code

3.The <head> tag that contains the metadata of a webpage, such as its <title>

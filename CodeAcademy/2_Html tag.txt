The <html> tag
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration provides the browser with two pieces of information (the type of document and the HTML version to expect), but it doesn¡¦t actually add any HTML structure or content.

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it¡¦s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.

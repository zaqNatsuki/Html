Unordered Lists
In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.

In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The <ul> element should not hold raw text and won¡¦t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

<ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>
In the example above, the list was created using the <ul> tag and all individual list items were added using <li> tags.

The output will look like this:
Limes
Tortillas
Chicken

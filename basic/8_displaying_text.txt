Displaying Text
If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:

Paragraphs (<p>) contain a block of plain text.
<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.
Take a look at each of these elements in action below:

<div>
  <h1>Technology</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p><span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.</p>
</div>
In the example above, there are two different <div>. The second <div> contains a <p> with <span>Self-driving cars</span>. This <span> element separates ¡§Self-driving cars¡¨ from the rest of the text in the paragraph.

It¡¦s best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, it¡¦s better to use a <div>.
